#### Courses on building AI projects

‚Äì [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) by NYU.  
_Full Stack Deep Learning helps you bridge the gap from training machine learning models to deploying AI systems in the real world._

‚Äì [Practical Deep Learning for Coders ](https://course.fast.ai/)by fastai.  
_It incorporates both machine learning and deep learning in a single course, covering topics like random forests, gradient boosting, test and validation sets, and p values, which previously were in a separate machine learning course. In addition, production and deployment are also covered, including material on developing a web-based GUI for our own deep learning powered apps. The only prerequisite is high-school math, and a year of coding experience \(preferably in Python\)._

#### Podcast

‚Äì [TWIML Podcast](https://twimlai.com/shows/) by Sam Charrington  
_"With the podcast we bring the top minds and ideas from the world of ML and AI to a broad and influential community of ML/AI researchers, data scientists, engineers and tech-savvy business and IT leaders."_
