– [Spinning Up in Deep Reinforcemnt Learning](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html) by OpenAI  
_An educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning \(deep RL\). Includes:_

* a short [introduction](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/blob/master/docs/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
* an [essay](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/blob/master/docs/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
* a [curated list](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/blob/master/docs/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
* a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
* and a few [exercises](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/blob/master/docs/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.
