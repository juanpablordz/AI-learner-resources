_This course will cover two areas of deep learning in which labeled data is not required: Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning. Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to realistically model high-dimensional raw data such as natural images, audio waveforms and text corpora. Strides in self-supervised learning have started to close the gap between supervised representation learning and unsupervised representation learning in terms of fine-tuning to unseen tasks. This course will cover the theoretical foundations of these topics as well as their newly enabled applications._

– [Probabilistic Generative Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqvdH_8lmCA&list=PLoZgVqqHOumTqxIhcdcpOAJOOimrRCGZn) by CMU  
_Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information. The probabilistic graphical models framework provides an unified view for this wide range of problems, enables efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets. This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models._
